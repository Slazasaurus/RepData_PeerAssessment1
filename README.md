## Hello

All figures are under the figure folder. You can also see copies of them in the activity.html and activity.pdf and likely the activity.md compilations of the activity.Rmd file.

The activity.Rmd file contains all code that was used to read, clean, manipulate, and plot aspects of the data. Please refer there if you need to recompile or run any of the code yourself.

If you wish merely to read the code and see the plots, I recommend the activity.md file, as this has the cleanest presentation on GitHub.

Thank you for reading!
