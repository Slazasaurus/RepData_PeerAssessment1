## Hello

All figures are under the figure folder. You can also see copies of them in the activity.html and activity.pdf and likely the activity.md compilations of the activity.Rmd file. Note there is no difference in content between activity.Rmd and PA1_template.rmd.

The activity.Rmd file contains all code that was used to read, clean, manipulate, and plot aspects of the data. Please refer there if you need to recompile or run any of the code yourself.

If you wish merely to read the code and see the plots, I recommend the PA1_template.md or activity.md files, as these have the cleanest presentation on GitHub. Note there is no difference in content between activity.Rmd and PA1_template.rmd.

Thank you for reading!
